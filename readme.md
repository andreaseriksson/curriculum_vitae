#Ruby on Rails Developer

###Presentation
Hi, my name is Andreas Eriksson and I am hereby applying for a position as a Ruby on Rails-developer.

I am 38 years old and live outside of Ystad in Sweden. I have about 7 years experience as a web developer and work mainly with PHP/CakePHP, Ruby on Rails, Coldfusion and ASP. Today I work for a small agency named Ahltorpmedia in Malmö. In my current position I am used to work independently with the big picture and take responsibility for the projects and the clients. My projects range from ordinary web sites to larger administrative systems (order management, CRM and CMS) which we builds from ground up. 

In my projects I work with HTML(5), CSS3, design, UX, SEO and responsive layouts. My work environment is Mac OS X on the desktop and deployment to Ubuntu server. I am also experienced with with Adobe Creative Suite, mainly Photoshop, Dreamweaver and Illustrator. I also have experience working with Git for versioning and Amazon S3 for cloud storage. For frontend development I am also very experienced with JQuery/Javascript. I mostly work with MySQL but also have experience in PostgreSQL and little experience with MongoDB. I´m equally comfortable in working with both backend and frontend development. 

I started with Ruby on Rails-development over two years ago and got a neck for it immediately. Since then I built all my private projects in Ruby on Rails and my work projects in Rails and CakePHP (which is a Rails clone in PHP). In my experience, Ruby on Rails is a superior framework that provides clear productivity benefits, more fun and yields in better end results. 

This is the main reason that I apply for the position with you. I want to develop as a web developer and specialize in Ruby on Rails. I know the Ruby language well and know about the conventions associated with the framework. 

As a person I am an innovative and creative person who is easy to get along with. I spend a great deal of my spare time researching web development and learning new techniques. I feel that I can see the broader picture bring it to the team.   

I hope this is enough as a presentation and if you feel that you need additional information, please call or send me an email. 

Best regards  
Andreas Eriksson
